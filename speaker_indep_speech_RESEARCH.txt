Research: Speaker-Independent Speech Separation With Deep Attractor Network

Deep ML has had a lot of struggle with speaker-independent speech separation. However, these authors have developed a deep learning framework that is able to address the challenges imposed by arbitrary order of the target and unkonwn number of speakers in the mixture. Using time-frequency representation and a reference point created in the embedding space, the authors were able to have comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-art deep learning methods for speech seperation.
