Text File for keeping activity log of work done for senior design 2018

Septemnber 11th, 2018:
This week I worked on brainstorming ideas for senior projects. One was a wireless EMG monitor that can potentially be used in hospitals, since they can be portable and much easier to move, etc. Justin Jose's cousin works as a nurse and states that it would be helpful if the EMGs were wireless. Another idea and a potential front-runner is a chess board that can be played using voice recognition, in which you do not have to move the pieces and can simply say a command to move the pieces. This can be useful for blind-folded chess and just a fun project in general.

This week we decided on an idea for our project and finalized groups. We decided on ultimately going with the real-time speech source separation project utilizing deep-learning. Our only other idea that gained traction and could potentially be a good project was the voice-activated chess, other-wise known as levitating chess. The problem with that idea was the level of difficulty and the lack of usefulness of the project. Therefore, we went with Professor Keene's suggested idea and are very happy with this project for the year.

This week I worked on Abstract write-up and researching for the project. Two articles I detail are described below:

Article: Speaker-Independent Speech Separation With Deep Attractor Netowrk
Deep ML has had a lot of struggle with speaker-independent speech separation. However, these authors have developed a deep learning framework that is able to address the challenges imposed by arbitrary order of the target and unkonwn number of speakers in the mixture. Using time-frequency representation and a reference point created in the embedding space, the authors were able to have comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-art deep learning methods for speech seperation.

This week I worked on research and looking at Frank's code for the project. I glossed over Frank's thesis and understand that there is a lot of signal processing involved in addition to the convolutional neural network implementation that Frank utilizes. I have also started to think about potential hardware choices for the project, with the Raspberry Pi 3 being the leader. These ideas have been discussed amongst the group. Two of the few articles I researched are summarized below.

This week we ordered the raspberry pi, mic and speaker that we will be using. The mic and speaker are tentative but the raspberry pi will be a permanent implementation unless we encounter problems with it. In addition, I continued to do research on the topic and below are another two summarizations of some of the articles that I've researched this past week.

This week I worked on research (final week of formal research prior to diving into the project, will still continue to do research on the side) with Justin on configuring the Raspberry Pi and understanding how to get the packages we need onto it. While Alex and John Tronolone scared us into thinking the RPi would not be simple to get our packages in, we were happy to find out that it was a simple process and Alex missed a step in the tensorflow installation. We've pretty much finalized the direction of the project and my primary role is the integration of Frank's code (which will be improved) to the RPi and getting that to work. I am also serving as a middle-ground man, since I do have knowledge of deep-learning (in Curro's class) and helping Justin out with the signal processing.

This week I worked on constructing the presentation for next week, creating and finalizing the Gantt Chart for our group for the remainder of the semester, focusing on how to integrate the RPi with the neural network code now that we have the necessary packages installed into the RPi and starting to think about the poster for the upcoming poster session.
